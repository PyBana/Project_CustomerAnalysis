# Customer Data Analysis and Visualization

## Overview

This project involves cleaning and analyzing customer data to understand their behaviors and personalities. The data was initially cleaned using Python Pandas, then normalized into relational tables in SQL, and finally analyzed and visualized using Power BI.

## Project Workflow

<b>1. Data Cleaning with Python Pandas:</b>
  -  Loaded the raw customer data into a Pandas DataFrame.
  -  Addressed missing values by either imputing or removing them.
  -  Formatted date columns and converted data types as needed.
  -  Created new columns for analysis, such as calculating customer age and days since last purchase.
 
<b>2. Data Normalization with SQL:</b>
  - Imported the cleaned data into an SQL database.
  - Designed relational tables to normalize the data, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
  - Created tables for customers, households, purchases, engagement, campaign responses, complaints, and constants.
  - Established primary and foreign key relationships between tables.
  - Inserted data from main table to the normalized tables.

<b>3. Data Analysis and Visualization with Power BI:</b>
  - Imported the normalized data from SQL into Power BI.
  - Created calculated columns and measures to derive insights, such as customer segments based on purchase activity and income groups.
  - Designed interactive dashboards with key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and graphs.
  - Visualized customer demographics, purchase patterns, campaign responses, and website interactions.

## Key Features

  - <b>Data Cleaning:</b> Efficient handling of missing values, data type conversions, and formatting using Pandas.
  - <b>Data Normalization:</b> Structured relational database design in SQL for optimized data management.
  - <b>Interactive Dashboards:</b> Comprehensive visualizations in Power BI to provide insights into customer behaviors and personalities.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to cleaning, normalizing, and visualizing customer data. By leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI, we can gain valuable insights into customer behaviors and personalities, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
